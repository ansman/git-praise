git-praise
==========
Sometimes you find the most amazing piece of code and want to know who to thank
for this wonderful contribution, and then it feels wrong to use `git blame`.

This is why `git praise` exists. Just praise that file and you'll find out who
to thank!

Usage
-----
The syntax is exactly the same as `git blame`.

Try doing `git praise path/to/some/file` or `git help blame` for all options.

Installation
------------
Just drop the script anywhere in your `$PATH` and git will pick it up.
